# Seto Kaiba Bot

A Discord bot that includes many server moderation tools including but not limited to: role management, voice/text channel management, announcements, and reminders. Utilizes canvasJS and MongoDB to allow users to create, save, and share their own duelist cards.

Streamlines server management/moderation for server owners and moderators by automating almost all of the processes that would normally require them to click through a bunch of windows.
